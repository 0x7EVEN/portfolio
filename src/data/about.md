# Some history

- Since childhood, I was very fascinated by technology, especially the field of computers and internet and the passion still continues. I started learning computer basics and networking , and started playing Capture the Flag competitions. Soon I got interest in building web and to learn it in more details I enrolled in Masai school.
Currently, 
- I am still developing myself. I've 3000+hr coding experience in JavaScript , Node , Python, C, Assembly and Database management with SQL and MongoDB. Also backend stack with Nodejs express and Mongoose. I'm competent with frameworks and libraries like React, Redux, Bootstrap, Material UI , styled components, react Strap etc. Apart from the curriculum, I sometimes work with Python, C, Cpp, Assembly 0x86, reverse engineering and binary exploitation with tools like ghidra, gdb-gef, radare2. I also love playing chess and sketching.

- At 15, I built my first website with weebly on my desktop, although it was template based it's terrible to share it here :P

- Ask me in person for other stories that I'm afraid to share with the internet.
