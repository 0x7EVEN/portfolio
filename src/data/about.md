Curious, learning enthusiast and detail-oriented aspiring full-stack developer with a specialization in MERN stack. Self motivated and hardworking, with a keen interest in implementing and learning. Apart from Web Development I have keen interest in Cybersecurity and [CTF](https://ctftime.org/) (Capture the flag competitions) primarily in Reverse Engineering and Web Expoitations.

At OLA, I have learned how to work with teams, achieve together, develop relationships, handle requirements, and build on-line predictive models with technologies like [React](https://ract.org/), [Flask](https://dagster.io/), [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), and [spaCy](https://spacy.io/). I primarily work as a cybersecurity engineer but apart from this I have interest in software development, Malware ananlysis, ctf compititions. 

# Some history

- Since childhood, I was very fascinated by technology, especially the field of computers and internet and the passion still continues. I started learning computer basics and networking , and started playing Capture the Flag competitions. Soon I got interest in building web and to learn it in more details I enrolled in Masai school.
Currently, 
- I am still developing myself. I've 1000+hr coding experience in JavaScript , Node , Python, C, Assembly and Database management with SQL and MongoDB. Also backend stack with Nodejs express and Mongoose. I'm competent with frameworks and libraries like React, Redux, Bootstrap, Material UI , styled components, react Strap etc. Apart from the curriculum, I sometimes work with Python, C, Cpp, Assembly 0x86, reverse engineering and binary exploitation with tools like ghidra, gdb-gef, radare2. I also love playing chess and sketching.

- At 15, I built my first website with weebly on my desktop, although it was template based it's terrible to share it here :P

- Recently I was recognised in multiple hall of fame, few to mention [austrolia post](https://auspost.com.au/about-us/about-our-site/responsible-disclosure), [pickerr](https://www.pickrr.com/hall-of-fame.html) ðŸ˜ƒ
